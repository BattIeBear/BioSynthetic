V1.6

Adds three new light sources that are built with Hemogen. While an expensive initial investment of hemogen, these lights provide a small but steady mood bonus to Sanguophages. The lights are set up to work with all vanilla styles.

Also comes with two settings, one that requires the "Bloodfeeding" meme to build and another that requires you to research the "Advanced Lighting" tech before you can construct.
