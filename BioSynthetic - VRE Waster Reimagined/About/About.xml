	<description>V1.6

A mod that reimagines Vanilla Races Expanded - Waster to address the waster's most glaring issue: their appearance. All wasters share the same skin and hair color as well as face-shape, meaning the only way to differentiate them is their hair style and apparel.

This mod addresses that by giving wasters access to a lighter gray and darker gray skin tone, as well as two new shades of black hair and a new dark brown hair for good measure. All of these colors are vanilla to keep them consistent with other pawns.

In addition, the "progressive cell instability" gene added by VRE - Waster has been removed, though to keep in line with the "bioweapon" angle of the mod the vanilla "mild cell instability" gene has been added.

The final change is the removal of the "gaunt body" gene, as their vanilla description specifically calls them "gaunt faced," not "skeletal."

This mod comes with several toggleable options, meaning you can have everything mentioned above or turn it all off one-by-one!
